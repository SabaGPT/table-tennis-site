    "In 1961, Beijing hosted China's first international event - the 26th World Table Tennis Championships.

Additionally, Lin Huiqing partnered with Zhang Xielin to win the mixed doubles gold, China's first in this event. By this point, Chinese names were engraved on all seven World Championship trophies. During this period, with central government approval, the Chinese table tennis delegation officially invited the U.S. table tennis delegation to visit, opening the door to Sino-U.S. relations after 22 years of isolation, known internationally as 'Ping-Pong Diplomacy.'",

  development_1977:
    "In 1977, marking the 50th anniversary of ITTF, England, the birthplace of table tennis, hosted the 34th World Championships. The Chinese team easily progressed and defeated Japan in the final to successfully defend the Swaythling Cup. The Chinese women's team, having trained hard against their main rivals North Korea and South Korea for the past two years, also successfully retained the Corbillon Cup.

  development_1983_1987:
    "From Tokyo in 1983, to Gothenburg in 1985, and New Delhi in 1987, the Chinese table tennis team demonstrated their extraordinary strength in these three World Championships, losing only one event in each championship while winning 18 out of 21 total championships. However, entering the late 1980s, concerns about the Chinese men's team gradually emerged. The European-originated horizontal grip topspin style gradually became mainstream in world table tennis, while the traditional Chinese penhold quick-attack style began to show its limitations.",

  development_1988_1991:
    "In 1988, table tennis made its Olympic debut, but the Chinese team struggled in Seoul, winning only men's doubles and women's singles titles. In 1989, under strong recommendation from Xu Shaofa, Cai Zhenhua returned from Italy to take up the position of men's team head coach, leading the Chinese team through difficult times. At the 2nd World Cup Team Championship that year, the Chinese men's team defeated Sweden in the final. However, at the 40th World Championships in Dortmund, they suffered a devastating 0:5 loss to Sweden, losing the Swaythling Cup they had held for eight years. In 1991, at the World Championships in Chiba, Japan, the men's team finished only seventh, and the women's team lost to the unified Korea team in the team final. However, it was at this championship that Chinese women's team legend Deng Yaping won the women's singles title, beginning her dominance of women's table tennis.",

  development_1992_1995:
    "In 1992, at the China Table Tennis Grand Prix in Chengdu, 16-year-old Liu Guoliang amazed everyone with his 'penhold horizontal attack' technique, defeating world-class players like Waldner and Kim Taek-soo. At the Barcelona Olympics that year, Wang Tao and Lü Lin won gold in men's doubles by defeating German stars Rosskopf and Fetzner, signaling the revival of Chinese men's table tennis. In 1995, the 43rd World Championships opened in Tianjin, China's second time hosting since Beijing in 1961. The Chinese men's team reached the final and defeated Sweden 3:2 to reclaim the Swaythling Cup. Inspired by the men's team's comeback, China repeated their 36th World Championships glory by sweeping all seven titles.",
